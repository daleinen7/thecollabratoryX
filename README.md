A tool for musicians to re-think how they approach songwriting/recording. Or a general source for inspiration. 

## Getting Started

[Go To App Here](http://www.the-collabratory.com/)

### The big Collabratory Button
When you press the button the Collabratory will give you a random assignment to add to your track. In some cases it will be a challenge. In some it will be an inspriation. My hope is that user submitted entries will be something I can't even predict here. 

### Entries
The user calls on the Collabratory to provide them with the next approach they should take with their song. The results come from a database of internal and user submitted entries. The entries are all grouped in collections called "sets".

### Sets
Some users will submit things that aren't applicable to all other users. That's okay. Just don't follow those sets. Or make your own even more specific sets! 

#### Guide
The Sets have entries in 4 main catagories. 

1. The instrument: the source of the sound they should use next.
2. The Effect: the way they should alter the instrument's sound.
3. The Role: the purpose the instrument is serving to the song.
4. Universal: A special entry that isn't specific to an instrument. If this entry gets call it's all that will display. 

### Technologies Used
Node.JS Express MongoDB
